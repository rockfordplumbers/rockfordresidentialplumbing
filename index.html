        <div class="text">
            <p>A faulty garbage disposal can lead to clogged drains, unpleasant odors, and inefficient kitchen cleanup. Common issues include jammed blades, motor failures, or leaks, often caused by food buildup or foreign objects getting stuck. Regular maintenance and proper use can prevent these problems.</p><br>
            <pIf your garbage disposal is making strange noises, failing to grind food properly, or not turning on at all, it may need professional repair. A technician can inspect the unit, remove blockages, replace worn-out parts, or even install a new disposal if necessary.

        </p><br>
            <p>To keep your disposal working smoothly, avoid putting fibrous foods, grease, or hard objects down the drain. Running cold water while using the disposal and occasional cleaning with baking soda and vinegar can help extend its lifespan.            </p><br>
